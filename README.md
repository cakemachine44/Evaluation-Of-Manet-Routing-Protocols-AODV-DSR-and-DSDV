Evaluation Of  Manet Routing  Protocols :  AODV, DSR, and  DSDV

This project demonstrates a comparative study 
between the MANET routing protocols AODV and DSR. This 
was achieved by transferring packets from a wireless source 
node to a wireless destination node while employing 
predetermined topologies applied on NS-2. The schemes consist 
of a basics network of nodes. The protocols will be evaluated and 
analyzed as per topology scenario while using the same 
evaluation rubric for each protocol. Overall, DSR was 
determined to be superior to AODV in practical wireless 
scenarios.
